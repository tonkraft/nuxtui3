    question: "Describe your experience with React and modern JavaScript frameworks.",
    answer: "I have over 5 years of experience with React, starting from class components to modern hooks and functional components. I've built several large-scale applications using React with Redux for state management, and more recently have been working with Next.js for server-side rendering. I'm also proficient in TypeScript and have experience with testing frameworks like Jest and React Testing Library. Additionally, I've worked with Vue.js on a few projects and understand the core concepts that translate across frameworks.",

    question: "How do you approach debugging complex technical issues?",
    answer: "My debugging approach is systematic and methodical. I start by reproducing the issue consistently, then use browser dev tools and logging to narrow down the problem area. I break down complex problems into smaller components and test each part individually. I'm comfortable with various debugging tools including Chrome DevTools, VS Code debugger, and network analysis tools. When stuck, I don't hesitate to collaborate with team members or research documentation and community resources.",

    question: "Tell us about a challenging project you've worked on recently.",
    answer: "Recently, I led the development of a real-time collaboration feature for our web application, similar to Google Docs. The main challenge was handling concurrent edits from multiple users without conflicts. I implemented operational transformation algorithms and used WebSockets for real-time communication. The project required careful consideration of user experience, performance optimization, and data consistency. We successfully launched the feature with 99.9% uptime and it increased user engagement by 35%.",
